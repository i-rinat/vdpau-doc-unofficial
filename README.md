vdpau-doc-unofficial
====================

About
-----

This is a rendered version of Doxygen documentation that comes with
[libvdpau](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/vdpau/libvdpau/) library.
Currently used version is 1.1.1. Libvdpau is an entry point for VDPAU
(Video Decode and Presentation API for UNIX).

Why
---

I'd like to have VDPAU documentation available online, but there are
no easy-to-access locations.
